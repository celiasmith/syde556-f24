Provide it with one input ```Node``` that has a constant value of ```[0.1]``` and connect that input into the ```Ensemble``` with a ```Connection```.  Now make a ```Connection``` from the ```Ensemble``` back to itself that computes the identity function.  Since this ```Connection``` is accumulating evidence over time, we want it to be fairly stable, so set ```synapse=0.1``` on this ```Connection``` (leave the other `Connection` at its default value).  This means that the neurotransmitter being used will spread out over 100ms, rather than the default 5ms.\n",
